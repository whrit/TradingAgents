Time Series Stock Data APIs
This suite of APIs provide global equity data in 4 different temporal resolutions: (1) daily, (2) weekly, (3) monthly, and (4) intraday, with 20+ years of historical depth. A lightweight ticker quote endpoint and several utility functions such as ticker search and market open/closure status are also included for your convenience.


TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY Trending

This API returns current and 20+ years of historical intraday OHLCV time series of the equity specified, covering pre-market and post-market hours where applicable (e.g., 4:00am to 8:00pm Eastern Time for the US market). You can query both raw (as-traded) and split/dividend-adjusted intraday data from this endpoint. The OHLCV data is sometimes called "candles" in finance literature.


API Parameters
❚ Required: function

The time series of your choice. In this case, function=TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY

❚ Required: symbol

The name of the equity of your choice. For example: symbol=IBM

❚ Required: interval

Time interval between two consecutive data points in the time series. The following values are supported: 1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 60min

❚ Optional: adjusted

By default, adjusted=true and the output time series is adjusted by historical split and dividend events. Set adjusted=false to query raw (as-traded) intraday values.

❚ Optional: extended_hours

By default, extended_hours=true and the output time series will include both the regular trading hours and the extended (pre-market and post-market) trading hours (4:00am to 8:00pm Eastern Time for the US market). Set extended_hours=false to query regular trading hours (9:30am to 4:00pm US Eastern Time) only.

❚ Optional: month

By default, this parameter is not set and the API will return intraday data for the most recent days of trading. You can use the month parameter (in YYYY-MM format) to query a specific month in history. For example, month=2009-01. Any month in the last 20+ years since 2000-01 (January 2000) is supported.

❚ Optional: outputsize

By default, outputsize=compact. Strings compact and full are accepted with the following specifications: compact returns only the latest 100 data points in the intraday time series; full returns trailing 30 days of the most recent intraday data if the month parameter (see above) is not specified, or the full intraday data for a specific month in history if the month parameter is specified. The "compact" option is recommended if you would like to reduce the data size of each API call.

❚ Optional: datatype

By default, datatype=json. Strings json and csv are accepted with the following specifications: json returns the intraday time series in JSON format; csv returns the time series as a CSV (comma separated value) file.

Advanced Analytics (Fixed Window)
This endpoint returns a rich set of advanced analytics metrics (e.g., total return, variance, auto-correlation, etc.) for a given time series over a fixed temporal window.


API Parameters
❚ Required: function

The function of your choice. In this case, function=ANALYTICS_FIXED_WINDOW

❚ Required: SYMBOLS

A list of symbols for the calculation. It can be a comma separated list of symbols as a string. Free API keys can specify up to 5 symbols per API request. Premium API keys can specify up to 50 symbols per API request.

❚ Required: RANGE

This is the date range for the series being requested. By default, the date range is the full set of data for the equity history. This can be further modified by the LIMIT variable.

RANGE can take certain text values as inputs. They are:

full
{N}day
{N}week
{N}month
{N}year
For intraday time series, the following RANGE values are also accepted:

{N}minute
{N}hour
Aside from the “full” value which represents the entire time series, the other values specify an interval to return the series for as measured backwards from the current date/time.

To specify start & end dates for your analytics calcuation, simply add two RANGE parameters in your API request. For example: RANGE=2023-07-01&RANGE=2023-08-31 or RANGE=2020-12-01T00:04:00&RANGE=2020-12-06T23:59:59 with minute-level precision for intraday analytics. If the end date is missing, the end date is assumed to be the last trading date. In addition, you can request a full month of data by using YYYY-MM format like 2020-12. One day of intraday data can be requested by using YYYY-MM-DD format like 2020-12-06

❚ Optional: OHLC

This allows you to choose which open, high, low, or close field the calculation will be performed on. By default, OHLC=close. Valid values for these fields are open, high, low, close.

❚ Required: INTERVAL

Time interval between two consecutive data points in the time series. The following values are supported: 1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 60min, DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY.

❚ Required: CALCULATIONS

A comma separated list of the analytics metrics you would like to calculate:

MIN: The minimum return (largest negative or smallest positive) for all values in the series
MAX: The maximum return for all values in the series
MEAN: The mean of all returns in the series
MEDIAN: The median of all returns in the series
CUMULATIVE_RETURN: The total return from the beginning to the end of the series range
VARIANCE: The population variance of returns in the series range. Optionally, you can use VARIANCE(annualized=True)to normalize the output to an annual value. By default, the variance is not annualized.
STDDEV: The population standard deviation of returns in the series range for each symbol. Optionally, you can use STDDEV(annualized=True)to normalize the output to an annual value. By default, the standard deviation is not annualized.
MAX_DRAWDOWN: Largest peak to trough interval for each symbol in the series range
HISTOGRAM: For each symbol, place the observed total returns in bins. By default, bins=10. Use HISTOGRAM(bins=20) to specify a custom bin value (e.g., 20).
AUTOCORRELATION: For each symbol place, calculate the autocorrelation for the given lag (e.g., the lag in neighboring points for the autocorrelation calculation). By default, lag=1. Use AUTOCORRELATION(lag=2) to specify a custom lag value (e.g., 2).
COVARIANCE: Returns a covariance matrix for the input symbols. Optionally, you can use COVARIANCE(annualized=True)to normalize the output to an annual value. By default, the covariance is not annualized.
CORRELATION: Returns a correlation matrix for the input symbols, using the PEARSON method as default. You can also specify the KENDALL or SPEARMAN method through CORRELATION(method=KENDALL) or CORRELATION(method=SPEARMAN), respectively.

HT_TRENDMODE

This API returns the Hilbert transform, trend vs cycle mode (HT_TRENDMODE) values.


API Parameters
❚ Required: function

The technical indicator of your choice. In this case, function=HT_TRENDMODE

❚ Required: symbol

The name of the ticker of your choice. For example: symbol=IBM

❚ Required: interval

Time interval between two consecutive data points in the time series. The following values are supported: 1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 60min, daily, weekly, monthly

❚ Optional: month

By default, this parameter is not set and the technical indicator values will be calculated based on the default length of the underlying intraday, daily, weekly, or monthly time series data. You can use the month parameter (in YYYY-MM format) to return technical indicators for a specific month in history. For example, month=2009-01.

❚ Required: series_type

The desired price type in the time series. Four types are supported: close, open, high, low

❚ Optional: datatype

By default, datatype=json. Strings json and csv are accepted with the following specifications: json returns the daily time series in JSON format; csv returns the time series as a CSV (comma separated value) file.

❚ Required: apikey

Your API key. Claim your free API key here.
